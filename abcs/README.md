The 'primer' for a newborn Cant system. It must learn these ABCs
first to be able to use the `library/`.

The source files here get specially loaded in the order they're
numbered. Early in the loading sequence, some basic workings are not
yet in place, putting limits on what kind of code can go there, beyond
just avoiding library functions not yet defined. See the comments.
