Playing with the call-by-value lambda calculus as a lab for how to
nicely implement fancier languages.

First: an interpreter.

Language:
Just cbv lambda calculus, but with a few conveniences:
 X constants / primitives for readable I/O
 X 'let' / 'to'
 X sugar for multiple args/params
 - some form of recursion?
