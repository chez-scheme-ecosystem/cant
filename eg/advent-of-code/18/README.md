Solutions for https://adventofcode.com/ 2018.

They're more or less refactored from my contest-time answers (though,
at this writing, mostly less after the first 10 or so). I'm using this
as a workout to improve Squeam, so I care the most about good
solutions being writable, not that they be the first I can think of.
